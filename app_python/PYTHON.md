# This application

## Flask

I used Flask as the backbone for this application. It is lightweight and straightforward. It does not require particular tools or libraries.

## pytz

I used pytz for time utils for its easy interface and helpful formatting.

## tests

I used pytest to test the landing page, whether it renders the local time string or not.
